# Rockstar PWA + Push Showcase

This is a simple proof of concept that demonstrates the capabilities of Push Notifications in progressive web applications.

## 💥 Features

✨ Installable on mobile and desktop devices. Mobile Safari 16.4+ compatible. \
✨ Utilizes the power of the Push API to enable push notifications. \
✨ Leveraging the Notification API to display user-friendly notifications. \
✨ Demonstrates the usage of the Badge API for adding badges to the app (mobile only). \
✨ Written in TypeScript. Powered by ViteJS. Uses React for rendering. \
✨ Utilizes GitHub Actions for building and deployment.

## 🎬 Demo

[Try it on you device](https://arusak.github.io/rockstar-pwa-push/). Don't forget to install the PWA! 

## 🚀 How to build it

Follow the instructions below to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arusak/rockstar-pwa-push.git
cd rockstar-pwa-push
npm install
```

To enable push subscription, you must set a few environment variables.
```
VITE_VAPID_KEY=<open key that is used by your push server>
VITE_PUSH_URL=https://example.org/request-push
```
When running locally, put them into .env.local file. When deploying, well, read you CD docs.

You might use my tiny push server (see the config in deploy.yml), though I recommend you to make your own.

### Start development server

To use HTTP/2 with TLS on development server, you need an SSL certificate for `localhost`. 
The [simplest way](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/) is to create a non-signed certificate and add it into trusted list.
Run the following script: 
```bash
mkdir ~/.openssl
openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key \
  -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
  -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config <( \
   printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")
```
Then add `localhost.crt` to the list of trusted certificates of you OS.

You'll need to add paths to generated keys to your environment when running dev server. Add the following lines to your `.env.local` config:
```
SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=~/.openssl/localhost.key
SSL_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=~/.openssl/localhost.crt 
```

To start the development server using good old HTTP 1.1 without TLS, forget about certs and just use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

### Building

To build the project for deployment, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `build` directory.

## 📱 iOS Compatibility

The project is fully compatible with iOS Safari, ensuring that the Push API, Notification API, and Badge API work seamlessly on iOS devices.
